Adding a Gravity Sensor
=======================

A major benefit of the Fermentrack framework is that gravity sensors are integrated as a central feature of the fermentation system, on an equal level with the temperature sensors used to control the fermentation process. Similar to Fermentrack's agnostic view towards BrewPi controllers (any controller using the BrewPi firmware can be integrated), Fermentrack provides the ability to integrate a variety of gravity sensors.
